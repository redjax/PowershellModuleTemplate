# Public/ directory

Any scripts defined here will be scanned when the module is imported, updating the manifest when a new function is added or an existing function is removed.

The functions detected in scripts in the `Public/` directory will all be exposed to the end user. If you do not wish to expose a function or variable to the end user, add it to [`Private/`](../Private/) instead.
